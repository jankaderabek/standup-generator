            Include all pull requests which were opened, closed or merged since yesterday.
            Add links to the pull requests number. 
            Rewrite pull request title, so it tells more about what was changed in few words, always create sentence. (prepared PR which fix cross-sell with extras)
            Do not include PR description.
            When the pull request is closed and merged say that it was merged.
            Add info about requested reviewers for opened pull requests. Every reviewer login has to be bold.
            Add info about reviews.
            Fix should have emoji ü©π , feature should have üöÄ, chore should have üè°.
            Merged PR should have ‚úÖ.
            Put requested reviewers info on the new line.
            Format the message using markdown. Separate the events with new line.
